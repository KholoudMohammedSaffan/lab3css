      <h2>Statue of Liberty</h2>
      <article>
        America's most iconic sight, the Statue of Liberty, is at the top of
        every first-time visitor's list of things to do in New York. It was
        France's gift to America. Built in 1886, it remains a world symbol of
        freedom and is one of the top attractions in America. It is one of the
        world's largest statues, standing just under 152 feet tall from the base
        to the torch, and weighing approximately 450,000 pounds. You can see the
        statue from land, with particularly good views from Battery Park, on the
        southern tip of Manhattan.

      <h2>Central Park</h2>
      <article>
        An oasis of green amongst New York's concrete canyons, Central Park is a
        sanctuary of peace and quiet for visitors and locals alike. A walk,
        pedal, or carriage ride through the crisscrossing pathways of Central
        Park is a must-do on anyone's New York City itinerary. In winter, you
        can even lace up your skates and glide across Wollman Rink. This huge
        park in the city center, a half-mile wide and 2.5 miles long, is one of
        the things that makes New York such a beautiful and livable city.
