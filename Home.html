    <p class="intro">My name is Patrick and I’m not a writer.
I have a background in photography. Visual communication is my strength; words don’t always come easily to me. While I don’t identify myself as a writer I’ve always been a traveler. From a young age, I was given the opportunity to travel. I spent countless hours on family road trips & vacations to what seemed, at the time, distant places. I got my first taste of the tropics in Hawaii and learned about ancient civilizations in Mexico. These experiences ingrained themselves on my psyche.  But, somewhere along the way, my life became focused on typical ‘adult’ worries we all know: careers, mortgages and bills leaving no time for travel.

I’m not affluent (unfortunately). I haven’t yet won the lottery. I have a profession that takes me away to work in the most remote reaches of northern Canada. I manage construction projects for weeks at time, without ever leaving the camp. These days and weeks in isolation are difficult & draining, typically broken up only by a few short days off at home; or worse—lay offs.
